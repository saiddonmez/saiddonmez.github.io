This paper addresses the challenge of limited observations
in non-cooperative multi-agent systems where agents
can have partial access to other agents’ actions. We present
the generalized individual Q-learning dynamics that combine
belief-based and payoff-based learning for the networked interconnections
of more than two self-interested agents. This
approach leverages access to opponents’ actions whenever possible,
demonstrably achieving a faster (guaranteed) convergence
to quantal response equilibrium in multi-agent zero-sum and
potential polymatrix games. Notably, the dynamics reduce to the
well-studied smoothed fictitious play and individual Q-learning
under full and no access to opponent actions, respectively. We
further quantify the improvement in convergence rate due to
observing opponents’ actions through numerical simulations.
