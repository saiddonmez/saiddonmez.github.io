I am currently pursuing an M.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University under [Dr. Muhammed SayÄ±nâ€™s](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/sayin/) supervision. I am a member of [Games, Decisions and Networks Lab](https://gdn.bilkent.edu.tr/), and my master studies span multi-agent reinforcement learning, algorithmic game theory, and networked games. Recently, my area of interest shifted towards robotics, and reinforcement learning.

I want to pursue Ph.D. in the area of robotics and learning next year. I am applying to top-tier robotics lab in the world for my Ph.D. studies.
